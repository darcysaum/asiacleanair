<p>Bangkokâ€™s reputation for filthy air is gradually evaporating and measures aimed at cutting
vehicle emissions and expanding mass transit are paying off. Between 1997 and 2007, the
city saw a 47 percent decrease in the amount of harmful small dust particles. Despite such
efforts, Bangkok's air quality still remains worse than that of Asia's cleanest cities, such as Tokyo and Singapore.</p>
